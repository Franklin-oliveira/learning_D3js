# Examples

In this folder I'm adding some examples of charts I did (with the help of the community) to learn how to do reproduce some simple charts like line charts, maps, networks and hierarchical plots.

**Note:** Most of the examples in this folder I reproduced using sample code I found in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), [bl.ocks.org](bl.ocks.org) and [blockbuilder.org](blockbuilder.org).
