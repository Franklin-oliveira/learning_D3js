# Interactive

In this folder I explored some slightly more advanced features which allows the user to interact with the charts and further explore the data, maybe extracting some valuable insights.

## Content

- **adding-legend.html:** revisited the gapminder example from previous section and added a legend to it. Now we can identify a continent by its color. See `./js/gapminder-legend.js`.
- **formatting-and-parsing.html**: example of how to use `D3 Format` for numbers, how to use string specifiers and use `D3 TimeFormat`and `TimeParse` to convert between strings and dates. All code for this is in `./js/formatting-and-parsing.js`.

## What I learned

- How to add legend to a chart with `svg` groups.
- How to use D3 to format numbers, strings and convert between different formats.
